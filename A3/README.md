# Assignment 2 Instructions 

1. First, make sure that all the .m and data files are in the same folder.
```
   The list of files are:
   assignment_3.m
   knnPred.m
   mylog2.m
   stump.m
   treePlanter.m
   treeRead.m
   knn_test.csv
   knn_train.csv
```

2. Next, open `assignment_3.m` in matlab.

3. Click the run button at the top.

4. You will most likely be prompted to change the current folder. Press the `add to path` button. 

5. The code will then run and display the relevant graphs in new windows. The relevant calculations will be displayed in the bottom `comand window`. You will likely have to scroll up to see all of them.
