function branch = stump(X, Y)
%% Parameters:
    % X - An array containing the feature vectors from each of the samples
    % Y - A vector containing the class to be predicted for each sample
    % N - The number of iterations
    % learn - the learning rate
    % Lam - the lambda used for regularization
    %       (if no regularization is desired use Lam = 0)
    % loss - A optional indicator for the type of output desired
                % If loss != 1 or is not inputed then the end W vector is
                % outputted
                % If loss = 1 then instead of the W being outputted a
                % vector of the loss function for every iteration is
                % outputted
