	\subsection*{1.1: Normalizing data and implementing K-NN}
After loading the testing and training data into feature matrices and vectors we normalized the data by calculating the minimum value, and the range $(max - min)$ of the training data for each feature and then normalized both the testing and training data using the training values
	
	Then we created a function that implements the K-NN algorithm with training data \( features and outputs\), testing features, and k as parameters

	The learning rate of $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ gives the fastest convergence. When we picked larger learning rates we started to get oscillations. If we include a couple of these rates, $3 \cdot 10^{-6}$ \& $5 \cdot 10^{-6}$, the plot looks as follows:
	
	\newpage

			\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{depth.eps} 
		\end{center} 
		\label{fig:M2}
	\end{figure}
	
	As we can see when the loss function approaches convergence at these rates we get oscillations. This makes sense because with a large learning rate the algorithm can overshoot the optimal solution
	
	\section*{Part 2: Testing and Training Accuracies}
	
	We then selected the learning rate of $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ to test the effects of iterations on the testing and training accuracies:
	\newpage
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]

		\label{fig:M3}
	\end{figure}

As we can see the training accuracy converges to 1 and the testing accuracy peaks at around 200 iterations and then remains constant. Something else that we thought was interesting was that if we used the learning rate of $1 \cdot 10^{-7}$ and plot the accuracies we get a better performance for the testing set at around 175 iterations and then it decreases to about the same performance as the $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ rate:

	\section*{Part 3: Deriving the Regularization Term}
Consider the new objective function:
	
	$$
	L(w) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} l(w^{T} x_{i}, y_{i}) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \Vert W \Vert_{2}^{2}
	$$
	
	This is the the same as the original objective function with an added term and since the gradient of a sum of functions in the sum of the gradients all we need to do is find the gradient of $\frac{\lambda}{2} \Vert W \Vert_{2}^{2}$:
	
	\begin{align}
	\nabla \frac{\lambda}{2} \Vert W \Vert_{2}^{2} &= \frac{\lambda}{2} \nabla \Vert W \Vert_{2}^{2} \\
	 &= \frac{\lambda}{2} \nabla \sum_{i = 1}^{m} w_{i}^{2} \\
	 &= \frac{\lambda}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
		 \frac{\partial}{\partial w_{1}} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} w_{i}^{2} \\ \\
		 \frac{\partial}{\partial w_{2}} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} w_{i}^{2} \\
		 \vdots \\
		 \frac{\partial}{\partial w_{m}} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} w_{i}^{2} \\
		 \end{bmatrix}\\
	&= \frac{\lambda}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
	2 w_{1} \\
	2 w_{2} \\
	\vdots \\
	2 w_{m} \\
	 \end{bmatrix}\\
	&= \lambda W
	\end{align}
	
Thus, the new batch gradient code would be as follows:\\
\\
Given: training examples $(x_{i}, y_{i}), i = 1, ..., N$ \\
$W \leftarrow [0, 0, ..., 0]$ \\
Repeat until convergence: \\
\tab $ d \leftarrow [0, 0, ..., 0]$ \\
\tab For i = 1 to N do \\
\tab \tab $\hat{y}_{i} \leftarrow \frac{1}{1 + e^{-w \cdot x_{i}}}$ \\
\tab \tab $error = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}$ \\
\tab \tab $d = d + error \cdot x_{i}$ \\
\tab $w \leftarrow w + \eta \cdot (d + \lambda w)$
		


	
	\section*{Part 4: Implementing Regularization}
	
To examine the effect of regularization on the algorithm we plotted the testing and training accuracies against the following choices of $\lambda$:

$$
\{\lambda = (4x + .5) \cdot 10^{3} |x\in{\mathbb{N} \cap [0,16]} \}
$$


It appears that for both the testing and training accuracies it starts at the maximum accuracy and then decreases from there:
\newpage


We then decided to zoom in a bit around where the function starts to decrease be examining the following lambdas:
	
	\begin{align}
		\lambda &= \begin{bmatrix}
		3.5 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		4 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		4.5 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		5 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		5.5 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		6 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		6.5 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		7 \cdot 10^{3} \\
		7.5 \cdot 10^{3}
		\end{bmatrix} 
	\end{align}
	
On closer look we can see a local maximum around 4500:

	
Though when examining the value at the local maximum, 4500, we found that it is the same accuracy value achieved at lower lambdas.
